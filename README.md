# üñ•Ô∏è Windows Server Installation & Domain Controller Setup

This lab demonstrates the complete process of building a **Windows Server 2025 virtual machine**, configuring core server roles, and promoting it to a **Domain Controller (DC01)**.  
It serves as a foundational step in enterprise network management and prepares the environment for Active Directory user, group, and policy management.

---

## üß© Overview

This project covers:
- Downloading and configuring a Windows Server VHDX image  
- Importing and setting up the virtual machine in UTM  
- Installing Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)  
- Promoting the server to a Domain Controller (`DC01`)  
- Verifying domain login with the administrator account

## üß± Environment

| Component | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Hypervisor** | UTM on macOS |
| **OS Image** | Windows Server 2025 Insider Preview (VHDX) |
| **Domain** | `lab.local` |
| **Hostname** | `DC01` |
| **Role** | Active Directory Domain Controller |
| **Network** | Static IP with DNS set to DC01 |
